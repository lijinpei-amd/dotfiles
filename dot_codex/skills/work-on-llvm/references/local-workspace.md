# Local LLVM Workspace Notes

Use this reference before running heavy LLVM commands, doing A/B comparisons, swapping worktrees, or preparing commits in this machine's LLVM checkouts.

## Worktrees

The LLVM setup uses many worktrees under:

```text
~/development/workspace/<NN>/llvm-project
~/development/repos/llvm-project
```

Multiple sessions may work in different worktrees concurrently, often on detached HEADs. Check:

```bash
git status --short --branch
git worktree list
```

Never use `git stash` here. The stash stack is shared by all worktrees using the common `.git`, so stash/pop can move another session's changes into the current worktree. Use one of these instead:

- Create `patch_file=$(mktemp "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/llvm-wip.XXXXXX")`, save
  with `git diff > "$patch_file"`, restore only files you own, then reapply it.
- Make a temporary local WIP commit in the current worktree and undo it with non-destructive commands after comparison.
- Copy only the input/output artifacts needed for an A/B test into a private
  directory created with `mktemp -d`.

## Build Directories And Tools

Prefer the build directory already associated with the checkout. Common forms are:

```text
<llvm-project>/build/bin/opt
<llvm-project>/../build/llvm-project/bin/opt
<llvm-project>/build/bin/llc
<llvm-project>/build/bin/clang
<llvm-project>/build/bin/mlir-opt
```

Discover the build instead of guessing:

```bash
find .. -maxdepth 3 \( -name opt -o -name build.ninja -o -name CMakeCache.txt \) -print
grep -E "CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE|LLVM_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS|LLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD|LLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS|COMPILER_LAUNCHER" <build>/CMakeCache.txt
```

Typical rebuilds:

```bash
ninja -C build opt
ninja -C build llc
ninja -C build clang
ninja -C build mlir-opt
```

Build narrow targets, preferably with assertions enabled. If a binary seems
stale, use `ninja -C build -d explain <tool>` first. `CCACHE_DISABLE=1` bypasses
ccache only for commands Ninja schedules; touch the relevant source or remove
the specific suspect output before running `CCACHE_DISABLE=1 ninja -C build <tool>`.

Typical focused tests:

```bash
build/bin/llvm-lit -q llvm/test/Transforms/InstCombine/foo.ll
build/bin/llvm-lit -q llvm/test/CodeGen/AMDGPU/foo.ll
build/bin/llvm-lit -q clang/test/CodeGenCXX/foo.cpp
build/bin/llvm-lit -q mlir/test/Conversion/GPUToNVVM/foo.mlir
```

Use `-sv` while debugging a failing single test, and `-q` for clean final reporting.

Broader tests:

```bash
ninja -C build check-llvm
ninja -C build check-clang
ninja -C build check-mlir
```

## Shared Library Build

This LLVM build links tools against shared `libLLVM*.so` libraries. Tool binaries such as `build/bin/llc`, `opt`, and `clang` may be thin wrappers. Copying only `build/bin/llc` does not snapshot behavior; the copy still loads the current shared library.

For A/B testing a CodeGen or transform change:

1. Build the changed version.
2. Create a private directory with
   `changed_libs=$(mktemp -d "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/llvm-libs.XXXXXX")` and copy the
   relevant `build/lib/libLLVM*.so*` files into it.
3. Restore/rebuild the base version without using `git stash`.
4. Run with `LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$changed_libs" build/bin/llc ...` versus the base libs.

This is especially useful for backend pass changes where relinking the shared library changes behavior while the tool binary itself may not change.

## Ccache And PCH

The workspace shares ccache across worktrees. Object files are intended to share well, but PCH files can be invalid across worktree paths.

If clang reports a stale `cmake_pch.hxx.pch` input path from another worktree:

```bash
find build -name '*.pch' -delete
CCACHE_RECACHE=1 ninja -C build <affected-pch-targets>
```

For a durable local fix, configure with `-DLLVM_ENABLE_PCH=OFF` if the build keeps serving stale PCH artifacts.

## Generated Checks

Use the update script from the source tree, not a hand-edited approximation:

```bash
python3 llvm/utils/update_test_checks.py --opt-binary build/bin/opt path/to/test.ll
python3 llvm/utils/update_llc_test_checks.py --llc-binary build/bin/llc path/to/test.ll
python3 clang/utils/update_cc_test_checks.py --clang build/bin/clang path/to/test.cpp
```

Adjust arguments to match the test's RUN lines. After regenerating, inspect the
diff for noisy unrelated changes. Then record the test file's checksum, rerun the
same updater, and verify the checksum is unchanged. This proves regeneration is
idempotent without requiring the intentional Git diff to be empty.

## Final Local Checks

Before reporting completion:

```bash
git diff --check
git status --short --branch
```

State exactly which tool rebuilds and lit targets were run.

When committing and pushing upstream work:

```bash
git clang-format --binary build/bin/clang-format HEAD~1 -- <files>
git push --force-with-lease lijinpei-amd <branch>
```

Use branch names like `YYYY-MM-DD-short-topic` when creating new branches for this workflow.
