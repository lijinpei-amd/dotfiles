#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Rename a tmux session after its working directory. Invoked from the
# `session-created` hook in ~/.tmux.conf:
#
#     set-hook -g session-created "run-shell \"~/.tmux/name-session.sh '#{session_id}'\""
#
# tmux expands #{session_id} to a stable identifier (e.g. "$3") before running
# this script, so we target that id explicitly and stay correct even if other
# sessions are created or renamed concurrently. The hook single-quotes the
# format so /bin/sh does not expand "$3" as a positional parameter -- see the
# comment in ~/.tmux.conf.
#
# Naming scheme:
#   .../development/workspace/<NN>/...  ->  ws<NN>   (one session per worktree)
#   anything else                       ->  directory basename
# Many worktrees share the same leaf directory (llvm-project/llvm, .../clang),
# so the basename alone collapses them; the workspace number disambiguates and
# matches the existing ws<NN> naming convention.
#
# Set NAME_SESSION_FORCE=1 to skip the default-name guard below, e.g. to
# retro-name sessions that were created before this hook existed.
